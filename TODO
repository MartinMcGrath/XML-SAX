TODO for XML::SAX

    - XML::SAX::Base could use getters for the handlers (it currently only has
      setters, which is not only weird but also a bit inconvenient when you 
      need to know what handler may be there). We should add getters that 
      follow the event spec hash, ie if you call get_content_handler and there
      is no ContentHandler, it'll return the Handler.
